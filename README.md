# Dotfiles and configuration files for NixOS
This is the working branch for the rewrite of my NixOS flake. Feel free to poke around. Maybe you find something you like or learn new things from it.

#### Keep in mind that it is a WIP and not complete at all! I'd even be surprised if it'd work right now to be honest.

## Where are the dots?
As you might have noticed, the dots folder is missing. The reason for that is that they will be added as Home Manager configuration files. If you want to use my dotfiles, check out the main or legacy branch for now. I haven't decided yet if I want to keep maintaining the dotfiles as their own files going forward.
