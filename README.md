# Dotfiles and configuration files for NixOS
This is my configuration for NixOS. Feel free to poke around. Maybe you find some things, you like or learn new things from it.

## Where did EasyNix go?
As time went on, it became harder and harder to maintain EasyNix. It was based on ZaneyOS 1.x and Zaney himself decided to pull the plug and rewrite ZaneyOS from scratch because ZaneyOS suffered from the same issue, EasyNix did. Since it's not working anymore, I decided to revive my old pre-merge branch and put EasyNix to rest. It's not deleted so if you want, you can check out the EasyNix branch.

## Where are the dots?
As you might have noticed, the is no dots folder. This is because I converted my dots to .nix files. If you want to see my dots as their own files, check out the legacy branch. Keep in mind, that the legacy branch is not planned to be updated any further so there's a chance of them being outdated.
