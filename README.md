# Dotfiles and configuration files for NixOS
This is my configuration for NixOS. Feel free to poke around. Maybe you find some things, you like or learn new things from it.

## Where are the dots?
As you might have noticed, the dots folder is now missing. This is because I converted my dots to .nix files. If you want to see my dots as their own files, check out the legacy branch. Keep in mind, that the legacy branch is not planned to be updated any further so there's a chance of them being outdated.
