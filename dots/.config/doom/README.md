# About my Doom Emacs config
I use a couple of extensions that should be installed for it to 100% work. These are:
* [nix-mode](https://github.com/NixOS/nix-mode)
* [markdown-mode](https://jblevins.org/projects/markdown-mode/)

## Installation of those extensions
Just press M-x and then type package-install and hit the Enter key. after that you type in the name of the extensions (shown above) and hit enter. After you installed both plugins, either reload the Doom config or restart Emacs.
