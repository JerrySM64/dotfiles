# AwesomeWM config
## Dependencies
This AwesomeWM config makes use of some [third party widgets](https://github.com/streetturtle/awesome-wm-widgets) made by [streetturtle](https://github.com/streetturtle). This config will error out when you don't have them in your awesome folder!

## How do I get the widgets?
You have to install them, by git cloning the repo linked above and placing the folder into the awesome folder.

## How do I remove the widgets so I don't have to get them?
I use two widgets: CPU and RAM. They get called in line 11 and 12 of the rc.lua file. Remove them and you can use the config without having to get the widgets.
